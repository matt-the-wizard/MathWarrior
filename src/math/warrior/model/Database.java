 * @version 1.0
 * Date Written/Updated: Oct 28, 2014
 * Class Description: SQLite Database that stores all information for the game. 
 * The database establishes the connection and then allows update and execute 
 * queries to be sent to the already existing tables in the database:
 * Rooms, Players, Monsters, Puzzles, Items etc.
 * This will allow storing and saving data as well as letting the user change data in 
 * the database for the creation mode. Where this class is implemented and operations
 * are called is where the handling of returned data will occur.
