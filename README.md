MathWarrior 
===========

MathWarrior is a text based adventure game written for school at Georgia Gwinnett College.

To run this game, make sure the sql lite jar file, the game database file, and the game music file are outside of the src directory in the java project in eclipse. All files are outside of the src folder, none have set file paths based on a single team members machine. We let java defaulty access them outside the source folder.
